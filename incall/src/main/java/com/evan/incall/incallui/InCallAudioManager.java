/**
 * This class implements QTI audio routing policy for upgrade/downgrade/merge call use cases
 * based on the audio policy below.
 *
 * Audio policy for any user initiated action like making a video call, accepting an upgrade
 * request or sending an upgrade/downgrade request is as follows : If any of the above user actions
 * indicate a transition to a video call, we route audio to SPEAKER. If any of the above user
 * actions indicate a voice call, we route to EARPIECE. For all other non-user initiated actions
 * like an incoming downgrade request, we don't change the audio path and respect user's choice.
 * For merge calls, we route to SPEAKER only if one of the calls being merged is a video call.
 *
 * Audio path routing for outgoing calls, incoming calls, add call and call waiting are handled
 * in Telecom layer. Same audio policy is followed for those as well. Any user initiated action
 * indicating a origin/acceptance of video call routes audio to SPEAKER or to EARPIECE for voice
 * calls.
